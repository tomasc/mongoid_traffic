# Mongoid Traffic

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomasc/mongoid_traffic.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tomasc/mongoid_traffic) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mongoid_traffic.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/mongoid_traffic) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/tomasc/mongoid_traffic.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/tomasc/mongoid_traffic)

Aggregated traffic logs stored in MongoDB. Based on the approach described by John Nunemaker [here](http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2011/06/28/counters-everywhere/) and [here](http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2011/07/31/counters-everywhere-part-2/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```Ruby
gem 'mongoid_traffic'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install mongoid_traffic
```

## Usage

Log your traffic like this:

```Ruby
Mongoid::TrafficLogger.log
```

### Optional arguments

#### Scope:

```Ruby
Mongoid::TrafficLogger.log(scope: '/pages/123')
```

#### User-Agent:

```Ruby
Mongoid::TrafficLogger.log(user_agent: user_agent_string)
```

#### Referer:

```Ruby
Mongoid::TrafficLogger.log(referer: http_referer_string)
```

(If the referer is included in the [bot list](http://www.user-agents.org/allagents.xml) the log will not be created.)

#### Country:

## Rails

In case of Rails, you can use the `.after_action` macro with the `#log_traffic` helper method in your controllers:

```Ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
	after_action :log_traffic, only: [:show]
end
```

Eventually the `:log_scoped_traffic` method which scopes the log by the current request path (`/pages/123`):

```Ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
	after_action :log_scoped_traffic, only: [:show]
end
```

You can override this behavior with custom scope like this:

```Ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
	after_action :log_scoped_traffic, only: [:show]

	private
	
	def log_scoped_traffic
		super scope: 'my-scope-comes-here'
	end
end
```

It might be good idea to use both methods in order to log access to the whole site as well as access to individual pages:

```Ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
	after_action :log_traffic, only: [:show]
	after_action :log_scoped_traffic, only: [:show]
end
```

## Accessing the log

### Access count

The total number of views within a specific month can be accessed like this:

```Ruby
Mongoid::TrafficLog.for_year(2014).for_month(8).access_count
```

The total number of views per scope per specific date like this:

```Ruby
Mongoid::TrafficLog.for_date(Date.today).for_scope('/pages/123').access_count
```
